# Heuristic evaluation
Perform a heuristic evaluation of a security feature in your web browser or on a website. You may find useful the classic article on [how to conduct an heuristic evaluation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/), by Jakob Nielsen.

1. Choose a set of heuristics. You may pick [Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), or Shneiderman's 8 golden rules of interface design (described in Chapter 10 of Lazar's book).
1. Apply 7 heuristics to a security feature in an application or website, or to a feature that impacts security even though security is not its primary function.  You should choose a feature that is large enough for you to evaluate across most of the heuristics, but small enough that you can reasonably evaluate it in a single assignment.
1. Document your results using screenshots of the application or website you are analyzing; if possible, draw over the images to highlight those features that you are focusing on when conducting the evaluation.  You are allowed to skip heuristics if they are not relevant to the feature you have chosen.  In these cases, document the heuristics and provide an explanation for why they are not applicable to your system.
1. Provide suggestions on how any potential problems could be improved. *Your suggestion might be a new design, change to a feature, or it might be a suggestion for additional empirical research.*
